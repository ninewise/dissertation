# UMGAP in practice
\label{chapter:in-practice}

Two things are required for UMGAP to be adopted for use. The first is
an up-to-date Unipept database. An outdated database would create an
out-of-date index file, and an out-of-date index file cannot be used
with newer samples. Section \ref{section:makedatabase} describes the
construction of the Unipept database for the Unipept webserver, desktop
client and metagenomics pipeline.

Second is a guide to use UMGAP. While the tools are well documented,
there are a lot of them and it might not be easy to combine them into a
pipeline. Of course, there are preconfigured pipelines available, but
users may still want to configure their own. To aid with this, and to
help users along with their analyses, several case studies were written.
These can be found in section \ref{section:casestudies}.
