## Case studies and analyses {#section:casestudies}

During development, the still incomplete pipeline was applied to several
datasets as a means of exploration. This has helped to find bugs,
usability problems, discover other applications and guide the UMGAP to
its final form. This section describes the analysis of these datasets,
as it would be done using the released version of the UMGAP, not as it
was executed originally. As such, this section may be used as a guide to
compose a new pipeline for a similar analysis.

The \ref{section:preconf} stuff.
