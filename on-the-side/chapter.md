# Putting It All In Action
\label{chapter:on-the-side}

This chapter describes some of the related work that happened alongside
the development of UMGAP. It starts with the construction of the Unipept
Database in \ref{section:makedatabase}. While the construction has much
changed since, it is still the solid backend of the Unipept webserver,
desktop client and metagenomics pipeline. Next, I highlight some of the
applications of UMGAP, using it on generated and actual data, guiding
the development (\ref{section:casestudies}). Finally, I list some other
projects I've participated in during my time as a PhD candidate in
\ref{section:relatedwork}.
