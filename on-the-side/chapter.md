# Putting it all in action
\label{chapter:on-the-side}

In this chapter, I describe some of the more or less related work
I did while developing the UMGAP. Just like my work on the Unipept
team as master thesis student, it starts with the construction of the
Unipept Database in \ref{section:makedatabase}. While the construction
has much changed since, it is still the solid backend of the Unipept
webserver, desktop client and metagenomics pipeline. Next, I highlight
some of the applications of the UMGAP, using it on generated and actual
data, guiding the development (\ref{section:casestudies}). Finally, I
list some other projects I've participated in during my time as a PhD
candidate in \ref{section:relatedwork}.
