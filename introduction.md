## Taxonomies - Classifying life

Upon hearing the term "Animal Kingdom", you might think of either the
jungle or the stories of Reynard the Fox, where the lion rules over the
other animals as King. Or you might be reminded of any other number of
movies, music albums or television series. Often in such stories, the
comparison is made between human and animals, either assigning animal
traits to humans or featuring anthropomorphic animals.

In evolutionary biology, the term "Animal Kingdom", or rather "Kingdom
Animalia", is a classification; a grouping of organisms. It is not the
only kingdom, but perhaps it is, for us humans, the most important
one, since we are part of it. Fortunately, despite calling it a
kingdom, there's no king we all are fealty to. The other kingdoms are
usually the plants (Plantae), Fungi, Chromista, Protozoa, Archaea and
Bacteria. Why usually? Well, life being life, the borders between these
classifications are a rather gray area and they have been reassigned
often. In fact, the study of naming and classifying groups of organisms
is a whole branch of biology, called taxonomy. Other than discussing
about the number of kingdoms, taxonomists also subdivide kingdoms in
phyla, those in classes, those in orders, and so forth. Each group of
organisms is called a taxon and may contain any number of other taxa.
kingdom, phyla and class are called taxonomic ranks. In this work, we
will be using a taxonomy with 29 named taxonomic ranks (though at the
start of my PhD, it had only 27), but in between those are many unnamed
ranks. The used taxonomy includes viruses as well as organisms.

Each taxon is directly contained by only a single other taxon, called
its parent. All taxa together are thus structured in a tree, sometimes
called the tree of life, with the group containing all organisms as
root of the tree. The taxa containing a taxon, all the way up to the
root, are called its ancestors; and all taxa contained within a taxon
are called its descendants. Do note that this does not imply a certain
organism of which all these organisms descend (in reproductive sense),
just that they are grouped together because they are showing similar
characteristics.

<!-- TODO tekening tree of life? -->

One of the interesting ranks of grouping organisms is the species,
near the bottom of the taxonomic tree. Whereas most taxa are assigned
subjectively by experienced taxonomists, a species is often defined as
the largest grouping in which every two organisms (of the appropriate
sexes or mating types) can reproduce, with fertile offspring. Still,
this definition does not include organisms which reproduce only
asexually, among others.

The first real taxonomy, by Carl Linnaeus (TODO ref), introduced the
ranked taxa and a naming system for animal and plant species. It was
based on visible characteristics, such as appearance and behavior. After
the evolutionary theory was published by Charles Darwin (TODO ref),
classifications would come to reflect common evolutionary descend. In
general, the closer two organisms are to their shared precursor, the
more grouped they are in a taxonomy.

The introduction of microscopic organisms into taxonomies puts a strain
on division by visible characteristics. These organisms are more easily
classified by studying their genetic material, carried by biopolymers.

## The Central Dogma of molecular biology

The most well-known carrier of genetic material is without doubt DNA,
or Deoxyribonucleic acid. A DNA molecule is a long polymer, formed by a
chain of small pairs of monomers. Each DNA monomer, called a nucleotide,
is composed of the sugar 'deoxyribose', a fixed phosphate group and one
of four nucleobases: cytosine (represented by a C), guanine (G), adenine
(A) and thymine (T). Each nucleobase pairs up with another (cytosine
with guanine and adenine with thymine) to form a base pair, via a
hydrogen bond. On the other side, the deoxyribose and phosphate group
bond respectively with the phosphate group of another monomer, and the
deoxyribose of yet another. As such, together, the deoxyribose-phosphate
alternations form two long strands, which spiral around each other
forming a double helix.

## Studying genetic codes

* Studies regarding DNA/RNA/proteins
  - genomics & metagenomics
  - scanproblemen -> shotgun metagenomics (concept read) (oplijsting machines, volumes)
  - proteomics & metaproteomics
  - scanproblemen -> I/L equation
  - transcriptomics & metatranscriptomics

## Existing Metagenomics Tools

* Existing metagenomics methods/tools
  - assembly: binning werkt niet goed met meer soorten
  - meest gangbare methoden

Conclusie: er zijn veel strategiÃ«n, ze werken allemaal op DNA.

## Metagenomics via eiwitten

Unipept werkt heel goed via eiwitten, we gaan de Unipept strategie proberen toepassen op reads.
