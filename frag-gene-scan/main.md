* **Abstract:** FragGeneScanRs is a better and faster Rust
implementation of the FragGeneScan gene prediction model for short and
error-prone reads. Its command line interface is backward compatible and
adds extra features for more flexible usage. Compared to the original C
implementation, shotgun metagenomic reads are processed up to 22 times
faster using a single thread, with better scaling for multithreaded
execution.

* **Availability and implementation:** The Rust code of FragGeneScanRs
is freely available from [GitHub][] under the GPL-3.0 license, with
instructions for installation, usage and other documentation.

## Introduction

Studying environmental communities of archaea, bacteria,
eukaryotes, and viruses is hampered by problems with isolating
and culturing most of these organisms in lab conditions
asdf [@locey;@rappe;@pedros;@hoferthemi;@hahn].
Metagenomics has therefore become a routine technique to bypass the
cultivation step with a combination of high-throughput DNA sequencing
and computational methods [@hugenholtz;@thomas]. Non-targeted
sequencing of genomes in environmental samples, called shotgun
metagenomics, in particular allows profiling of both the taxonomic
composition and the functional potential of the samples [@quince].
Identification of protein coding sequences from shotgun metagenomic
reads has therefore become an important precursor to gain insight in
the taxonomic and functional diversity of an environmental community
[@sharpton].

One approach for shotgun metagenomics gene prediction is assembling
reads into longer contiguous sequences, called contigs, prior to running
traditional gene prediction tools [@breitwieser]. This eases
gene prediction, but assembling reads from complex samples with many
species in different abundances is a challenging problem. It requires
special-purpose algorithms that can be slow, produce artificial contigs,
and miss low-abundance genomes [@ghurye; @vollmers]. Direct gene
prediction on individual reads can mitigate assembly problems, speed
up computations, and enable profiling of low-abundance organisms that
cannot be assembled _de novo_. But, it does have to face partial
protein coding fragments with missing start/stop codons and read errors
[@quince]. The choice between assembly-based versus read-based gene
prediction may depend on the sample type and the research question at
hand.

Various gene prediction tools specialize in directly calling short
reads [@hyatt;@hoff;@zhu;@noguchi]. FragGeneScan (FGS)
is the most accurate and popular tool that is currently available
[@trimble]. It uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates
codon usage bias, start/stop codon patterns, and sequencing error models
to predict complete or partial genes in short error-prone reads. Back
in 2010, the gene prediction model of FGS was implemented in C and Perl
[@rho]. Multithreading support was added in release 1.19 (August
2014) and most Perl code was replaced with C functions in release 1.30
(April 2016). Because FGS was rather slow, a team of researchers at
the University of British Columbia (Canada) forked FGS (presumably
from release 1.19) to implement FragGeneScan-Plus (FGS+): a pure C
implementation with speedups for single threaded execution and better
scaling for multithreading [@kim].

Both FGS and FGS+ now have pure C implementations that support parallel
execution, but their latest releases suffer from their own issues. FGS
implements multithreading in a very inefficient way, making it much
slower than FGS+. The implementation doesn't preserve input order,
breaking for example the synchronisation between pair-end read files
without an extra sorting step in postprocessing. Bugs have also been
introduced when replacing Perl code with C functions. In addition,
out-of-bound memory access may corrupt its results and cause the
software to crash.

FGS+ has inherited inefficient memory usage from FGS and made it
worse by copying immutable data structures to individual threads and
introducing leaks in the allocated memory. Its multithreading model
is overly complex and may deadlock due to race conditions in thread
semaphores especially when using a larger number of threads. Although
FGS+ is faster than FGS, its results may significantly deviate due to
bugs introduced in the reimplementation and missing bug fixes from later
FGS versions. For example, FGS+ systematically makes wrong translations
of genes encoded on the reverse strand, may result in out-of-bound
memory access when copying FASTA headers from a dynamically allocated
global array to thread-specific arrays that are statically allocated,
uses fixed-length string buffers of 1MB for DNA sequences that overflow
for complete genomes, and also crashes when reading from standard input
and writing to standard output. In conclusion, FGS generates more
accurate results but is slower, whereas FGS+ is considerably faster but
generates wrong output.

The source code of FGS and FGS+ is no longer actively maintained, but
as metagenomics datasets continue to grow in size, we still need faster
gene predictors. In this manuscript we present FragGeneScanRs (FGSrs), a
reliable, high-performance, and accurate Rust implementation of the FGS
gene prediction model. We ran a benchmark to show that FGSrs produces
the same results as FGS and is faster than both FGS and FGS+.

## Implementation

FGSrs is implemented in Rust, a programming language known for its
focus on speed and memory-efficiency. In addition, segmentation faults
that occur while running FGS or FGS+ are automatically avoided because
memory-safety and thread-safety are guaranteed by Rust’s type system and
ownership model. Its zero-cost abstractions yield more readable code and
put optimizations in the hands of the compiler.

We started off with a Rust implementation that was equivalent to FGS
release 1.31. Afterwards, we gradually optimized performance and
improved the quality of the software, while monitoring equivalence with
the original implementation. We outline some of these optimizations
and improvements in what follows and refer to the source code and its
documentation for more details.

FGS uses statically allocated 300 KB buffers for different
representations of reads and 100 KB buffers for protein translations.
By using dynamically allocated buffers that grow when needed instead,
we avoid static buffer overflows, increase speed, and reduce the memory
footprint.

FGS stores default training data for its HMM in separate text files. We
include a binary representation of default data in the executable during
compilation, but still support passing custom training data as command
line arguments. This improves usability by reducing dependencies during
installation of the software and allowing to execute FGSrs with default
training data anywhere on the system without the need to run FGS in its
own directory or explicitly pass the path to the default training files
(new option `-r`).

The HMM configurations used by FGS are immutable after initialization,
but the original implementation wastes memory by copying them to each
thread. We store this data in shared memory that threads can access
concurrently. We use mutexes for protected access to shared input and
output file handles. This avoids the need to split input in chunks
upfront, have threads that store results per chunk in a separate file,
and merge these files afterwards. This eliminates disk overhead and
speeds up I/O.

HMM gene regions have six inhomogeneous sets of states that represent
matches, insertions and deletions for two successive codons in a read.
FGS processes the six states in a loop, combined with conditional
execution to handle topological differences between state transitions.
Unrolling these loops not only makes the condition-less code more
readable, it is also significantly faster. We have further improved
readability of the code by replacing #define constants in C with Rust
enum types.

Where FGS uses row-major order to store dynamic programming matrices,
we switched to column-major order for improved locality when accessing
matrix elements in the Viterbi algorithm. This results in a speedup
because the reordered memory layout causes less cache misses.

FGS outputs the DNA sequence, its translated amino acid sequence,
and additional metadata for each coding region found in a read, with
optional formatting to indicate insertions and deletions in the DNA
sequence. This requires FGS to compute and store the DNA sequence twice
during the backtracking step at the end of the Viterbi algorithms.
Once for reconstructing the formatted DNA sequence and once for
reconstructing the unformatted DNA sequence. We produce a unified
representation and delay formatting until output is generated. We
also note that a bug was introduced in FGS (release 1.30) when the
backtracking step was converted from Perl to C, which generates DNA and
protein sequences for complete genomes that are incorrect.

## Results

The FGSrs command line interface is backward compatible with FGS, so
it can be used as a faster and memory-friendly drop-in replacement
for FGS in bioinformatics pipelines. FGSrs also has some additional
features that enable more flexible usage. We support the conventional
standard input and output channels as alternatives for passing files as
arguments to the `-s` and `-o` options. This enables embedding FGSrs in
POSIX pipes without storing intermediate results on the file system.
Storage locations for generated DNA sequences (option `-n`), translated
amino acid sequences (option `-a`) and metadata (option `-m`) can also
be specified individually, which may give additional speedups because
unspecified information does not need to be computed. Where FGS and FGS+
report gene predictions out-of-order, FGSrs by default preserves read
order. The priority queue that guarantees in-order reporting comes with
a small overhead on speed and memory usage, but can be disabled with the
option `-u`.

We ran a benchmark on a 16-core Intel® Xeon® CPU E5-2650 v2 at 2.60 GHz,
to evaluate the performance improvements of FGSrs (release 1.0.0) over
FGS (release 1.31) and FGS+ (git version 91b0ab6). The sample datasets
included in the FGS and FGSrs repositories are used as input data and
measurements are averaged over 5 runs. When all three implementations
are executed single threaded (Figure \ref{fig:01}), FGSrs processes
short reads (80 bp) $22.6\times$ faster than FGS and $1.2\times$ faster
than FGS+. Long reads (1\,328 bp) are processed $4.2\times$ times faster
than FGS and $1.6\times$ faster than FGS+. The bulk of the runtime is
consumed by the Viterbi algorithm, having a time complexity of $O(s^2
\times n)$ with $s$ the number of HMM states and $n$ the length of
the sequence that needs to be processed. Because the HMM of the gene
prediction model has a fixed number of states ($s=49$), we can thus
expect runtime to grow linearly for reads that are even longer. FGSrs
processes the complete genome sequence of _Escherichia coli_ str. K-12
subst. MG1665 (NC\_000913; 4\,639\,675 bp) $2.2\times$ faster than FGS
and $347.6\times$ faster than FGS+. The latter measurement essentially
shows that FGS+ is not fit for processing complete genomes in practice.
FGSrs and FGS+ scale better for multithreaded execution than FGS (Figure
\ref{fig:02}). Increasing the thread count from 1 to 8, this results in
a speedup factor of 6.5 for both FGSrs and FGS+ and only 5.4 for FGS.
The difference increases for higher thread counts and the execution even
consistently halts due to race conditions for FGS+ when using more than
10 threads. FGSrs and FGS have a comparable memory footprint of about
$(80 + 70t)$ MB for $t$ threads (Figure \ref{fig:03}). FGS+ consumes
more memory with about $(265 + 85t)$ MB for $t$ threads. However, the
memory requirements are not a limiting factor to run any of these tools
on a standard laptop, with 4 threads needing between 350MB and 520MB
RAM.

In conclusion we can state that FGSrs is a reliable implementation of
the FGS gene prediction model that is an order of magnitude faster than
the original implementation. Its command line interface is backward
compatible with extensions for more flexible usage. The source code of
FGSrs is freely available from [GitHub][] under the GPL-3.0 license,
